      <p>The Active Highway Projects Viewer is an open-source, public-facing interactive dashboard that
        enables users to explore current and awarded highway construction projects in Kentucky — independently
        of the Esri software stack. Built with modern JavaScript frameworks and leveraging open data APIs
        and spatial visualizations, the application empowers the public, contractors, and government
        stakeholders with intuitive access to authoritative project data.</p>
      <p>At its core, this tool visualizes the Approved Six-Year Highway Plan (6YP) for the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
        Required by Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 176, the 6YP is a legislatively approved supplement to the Executive
        Branch Biennial Budget that provides funding for major highway improvement projects scheduled for the upcoming
        two years and approved by the Kentucky General Assembly. The 6YP is developed through collaborative input from
        the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC), local governments, and regional planning organizations, including
        Area Development Districts (ADDs), Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), and Highway District
        Offices.</p>
      <p>The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the 6YP, including project locations,
        descriptions, and funding sources. Users can filter projects by county, district, or project type derived from
        this plan, with data reflecting the availability of both state and federal highway funds.</p>
      <p>Designed for user experience, accessibility, performance and responsiveness, the dashboard supports map-based
        exploration, interactive filtering, and dynamic charting. It integrates with the KYTC Spatial API and
        public data files, allowing users to access route-specific information, making it a valuable tool for planning
        and public engagement in infrastructure development.

      <summary><h2 id="problem">Problem Statement</h2></summary>
      <p>The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) offers GIS-based access to construction project data using Esri
        proprietary tools. However, this approach limits public access due to licensing, performance issues, and
        limited interoperability. Users looking to explore highway projects often find the existing interfaces
        unintuitive and inflexible.</p>
      <p>This project aims to create an open-source, device-responsive, non-ESRI dashboard that presents current
        transportation project data in a visually informative and user-friendly manner. It also aims to develop modular
        functions for integration into similar dashboards.</p>

      <h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>
      <p>
        The project initial goals and objectives included in the original project proposal have been implemented in
      current design as follows::
        <ol>
          <li>Interactive dashboard using open web technologies to explore active KYTC highway projects
            <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactive data exploration.</p>
          <li>Replace reliance on proprietary mapping tools with Leaflet.js and open APIs</li>
            <p>✔️ Implemented. Leaflet.js is used for mapping (see index.html), replacing Esri tools.</p>
          <li>Integrate public API endpoints, such as the KYTC Spatial API, to retrieve route-specific data.</li>
            <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard includes integration with KYTC Spatial API for route data.</p>
        <li>Use SQLite to store and query project data for portability and offline access.</li>
          <p>✔️ Implemented. SQLite is used to store project data, allowing for efficient querying and offline access.
            Modifications were made in the planned storage of the spatial data in geojson format for performance optimization
            in the map. While geojson strings can be stored in a TEXT column inside an SQLITE database, it was determined that
            the most direct method was to read directly from the geojson files.</p>
        <li>Provide a responsive, user-friendly interface for exploring project data on various devices.</li>
          <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, adapting to different screen sizes.</p>
        <li>Enable data export in common formats (CSV, Excel) for further analysis.</li>
          <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard allows users to export project data in CSV and Excel formats directly from the
            integrated data table.</p>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>The features chosen for this project and included in the original project proposal ranged from mandatory to optional. All of
       the mandatory features have been implemented, and some of the optional features have been included as well.
       <ol>
        <li><h4>MANDATORY: Third-party API Integration</h4></li>
          <p>✔️ Implemented. Integrated with the KYTC Spatial API to return route-specific project data. This functionality
            is accessed through one of the function buttons on the Leaflet map.</p>
        <li><h4>Choose at least three items from the FEATURES LIST:</h4></li>
            <h5>First Set (Choose Two)</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Analyze data stored in arrays, objects, sets, or maps, and display information in the app.</li>
                <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard processes project data from GeoJSON/SQLite tables/views and displays the
                  information in both charts and a full data table within the user-interface. Functions within the map
                  allow the user to drill down to a district or county and not only see the same filters applied to the
                  charts, but also to click on a specific project line to return summary project information for that project.</p>
              <li>Visualize data in a user-friendly way (e.g., graph, chart, etc.)</li>
                <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard uses an interactive map, a pie chart, and a bar chart to display information
                  in an informative way.  The map is Leaflet displaying geojson files for projects. The two charts use the
                  Chart.js library.</p>
            </ol>
            <h5>Second Set (Choose One)</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Implement modern interactive UI features (e.g., table/data sorting, autocomplete, drag-and-drop,
                calendar-date-picker, etc.)
                <p>✔️ Implemented. The county filter incorporates autocompletion as the user types in the desired county
                  name. This makes keeping the number of options in the dropdown manageable. The dashboard data table
                  uses Tabulator.js for advanced data table features, including sorting,filtering, and exporting data
                  to Excel/CSV formats.</p>
            </ol>

            </p></li>
       </ol>

    </p>

        <li>Create a modular architecture for easy integration into other projects.</li>
          <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard is designed with modular components, making it easy to integrate into other projects.</p
    </p>

          <h2 id="overview">Capstone Project Overview</h2>
        </summary>
        <p>This project is a culmination of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the CodeYou program. It
          demonstrates
          the ability to design and implement a complex, interactive web application that meets real-world needs. The
          project showcases
          the use of modern web technologies, data visualization techniques, and API integration to create a functional and
          user-friendly
          dashboard for exploring highway projects in Kentucky.</p>
        <p>The dashboard utilizes open web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, Chart.js, and
          Tabulator.js. This approach eliminates dependence on proprietary Esri tools, thereby removing licensing barriers
          and ensuring the tool is freely accessible to the public.</p>
        <p>The interface is designed to be responsive, effortlessly adapting to various devices and screen sizes. With
          features such as filtering, charting, and map-based exploration, the dashboard is both user-friendly and
          intuitive, effectively addressing the shortcomings of previous solutions.</p>

        <p>By using lightweight libraries and directly interacting with GeoJSON data, the dashboard boosts performance and
          makes it easier to link up with other open data sources and APIs. We’ve integrated SQLite for efficient data
          storage and querying, which also enables offline access.</p>
        <p>Connecting with the KYTC Spatial API and public data files gives users the ability to access route-specific
          project metadata freely, promoting transparency and encouraging public participation.</p>

        <summary>
          <h2 id="functionality">Code Functionality and Use:</h2>
        </summary>
        <p>JavaScript is the backbone of the dashboard's interactivity, visulization, and modularity, making the application
          functional, user-friendly, and responsive.</p>
        <p>It is essential for enabling all of the dynamic features of the dashboard:
        <ul>
          <li>Data Loading & API Integration:</li>
          <p>JavaScript fetches project data from GeoJSON files, SQLite databases, and the KYTC Spatial API.
            This allows the dashboard to display up-to-date information and route-specific metadata.</p>
          <li>Map Visualization:</li>
          <p>Using Leaflet.js, JavaScript renders interactive maps, displays project locations, and
            enables user interactions such as clicking on features to view details.</p>
          <li>Charting & Data Visualization:</li>
          <p>JChart.js is used via JavaScript to generate dynamic pie and bar charts, helping users
            visualize project distributions and summaries.</p>
          <li>Filtering & Sorting:</li>
          <p>JavaScript powers the filtering logic, allowing users to select counties, districts, or project types. It
            updates the
            map, charts, and data table in real time based on user selections.</p>
          <li>Interactive Data Table:</li>
          <p>Tabulator.js is used to create sortable, filterable, and exportable tables. JavaScript manages the table’s
            data, updates
            it when filters change, and enables export to CSV/Excel.</p>
          <li>Responsive UI & Modular Components:</li>
          <p>JavaScript ensures the dashboard adapts to different devices and screen sizes, and supports modular
            architecture so
            components (map, charts, table) can be reused or extended.</p>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Modularization</h3>

        <p>A challenging aspect of this project has been modularizing the dashboard's codebase. Ensuring
          that each component is self-contained and reusable requires careful planning and implementation.
        </p>
        <p>Modularizing the JavaScript used in the dashboard into modules involves separating out the logic, handling shared
          state, abstracting integrations with third-party services, reworking styles, and creating clear interfaces for
          each component. While this process can take a significant amount of time, it will significantly enhance both the
          reusability and maintainability of the project.</p>
        <p>There are certain parts of the logic that connects the map charts and table, which makes it tough to break them
          down into separate parts. Nonetheless, the overall structure is built with future improvements and modularity in
          mind.

        <h3>CodeYou Experience</h3>
        <p>The Web Development Cohort has been my second experience with Code:You. Last year, I took part in the Data
          Analytics Cohort, which gave me a solid grounding in data analysis and visualization. This year, I've been
          building on my old JavaScript skills to explore new methodologies and tools, all with the goal of developing
          interactive and user-friendly web applications.</p>
        </p>
        <p>I can't say I have mastered this skill, but I am honing my ability to prototype and iterate on ideas with
          JavaScript frameworks like React and Svelte. While I am still learning these frameworks, this skill will
          significantly boost my efficiency and effectiveness in upcoming projects.</p>
