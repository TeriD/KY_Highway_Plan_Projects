      <p>The Active Highway Projects Viewer is an open-source, public-facing interactive dashboard that
        enables users to explore current and awarded highway construction projects in Kentucky — independently
        of the Esri software stack. Built with modern JavaScript frameworks and leveraging open data APIs
        and spatial visualizations, the application empowers the public, contractors, and government
        stakeholders with intuitive access to authoritative project data.</p>
      <p>At its core, this tool visualizes the Approved Six-Year Highway Plan (6YP)—a legislatively
        approved framework updated every two years by the Kentucky General Assembly. The 6YP outlines major
        highway improvement projects across the state and is developed through collaborative input from KYTC,
        Area Development Districts (ADDs), Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), and Highway District
        Offices. The Viewer displays currently active and awarded projects derived from this plan, with data
        reflecting the availability of both state and federal highway funds.</p>
      <p>Designed for user experience, accessibility, performance and responsiveness, the dashboard supports
        interactive filtering, dynamic charting, map-based exploration, and integration with state-maintained APIs,
        making it a valuable tool for planning, transparency, and public engagement in infrastructure development.

      <summary><h2 id="problem">Problem Statement</h2></summary>
      <p>The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) offers GIS-based access to construction project data using Esri
        proprietary tools. However, this approach limits public access due to licensing, performance issues, and
        limited interoperability. Users looking to explore highway projects often find the existing interfaces
        unintuitive and inflexible.
      </p>
      <p>This project aims to create an open-source, device-responsive, non-ESRI dashboard that presents current
        transportation project data in a visually informative and user-friendly manner. It also aims to develop modular
        functions for integration into similar dashboards.

      <h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>
      <p>
        The project initial goals and objectives included in the original project proposal have been implemented in
      current design as follows::
        <ol>
          <li>Interactive dashboard using open web technologies to explore active KYTC highway projects
            <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactive data exploration.</p>
          <li>Replace reliance on proprietary mapping tools with Leaflet.js and open APIs</li>
            <p>✔️ Implemented. Leaflet.js is used for mapping (see index.html), replacing Esri tools.</p>
          <li>Integrate public API endpoints, such as the KYTC Spatial API, to retrieve route-specific data.</li>
            <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard includes integration with KYTC Spatial API for route data.</p>
        <li>Use SQLite to store and query project data for portability and offline access.</li>
          <p>✔️ Implemented. SQLite is used to store project data, allowing for efficient querying and offline access.
            Modifications were made in the planned storage of the spatial data in geojson format for performance optimization
            in the map. While geojson strings can be stored in a TEXT column inside an SQLITE database, it was determined that
            the most direct method was to read directly from the geojson files.</p>
        <li>Provide a responsive, user-friendly interface for exploring project data on various devices.</li>
          <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, adapting to different screen sizes.</p>
        <li>Enable data export in common formats (CSV, Excel) for further analysis.</li>
          <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard allows users to export project data in CSV and Excel formats directly from the
            integrated data table.</p>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>The features chosen for this project and included in the original project proposal ranged from mandatory to optional. All of
       the mandatory features have been implemented, and some of the optional features have been included as well.
       <ol>
        <li><h4>MANDATORY: Third-party API Integration</h4></li>
          <p>✔️ Implemented. Integrated with the KYTC Spatial API to return route-specific project data. This functionality
            is accessed through one of the function buttons on the Leaflet map.</p>
        <li><h4>Choose at least three items from the FEATURES LIST:</h4></li>
            <h5>First Set (Choose Two)</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Analyze data stored in arrays, objects, sets, or maps, and display information in the app.</li>
                <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard processes project data from GeoJSON/SQLite tables/views and displays the
                  information in both charts and a full data table within the user-interface. Functions within the map
                  allow the user to drill down to a district or county and not only see the same filters applied to the
                  charts, but also to click on a specific project line to return summary project information for that project.</p>
              <li>Visualize data in a user-friendly way (e.g., graph, chart, etc.)</li>
                <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard uses an interactive map, a pie chart, and a bar chart to display information
                  in an informative way.  The map is Leaflet displaying geojson files for projects. The two charts use the
                  Chart.js library.</p>
            </ol>
            <h5>Second Set (Choose One)</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Implement modern interactive UI features (e.g., table/data sorting, autocomplete, drag-and-drop,
                calendar-date-picker, etc.)
                <p>✔️ Implemented. The county filter incorporates autocompletion as the user types in the desired county
                  name. This makes keeping the number of options in the dropdown manageable. The dashboard data table
                  uses Tabulator.js for advanced data table features, including sorting,filtering, and exporting data
                  to Excel/CSV formats.</p>
            </ol>

            </p></li>
       </ol>

    </p>

        <li>Create a modular architecture for easy integration into other projects.</li>
          <p>✔️ Implemented. The dashboard is designed with modular components, making it easy to integrate into other projects.</p
    </p>

      <summary><h2 id="overview">Capstone Project Overview</h2></summary>
    <p>This project is a culmination of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the CodeYou program. It demonstrates
      the ability to design and implement a complex, interactive web application that meets real-world needs. The project showcases
      the use of modern web technologies, data visualization techniques, and API integration to create a functional and user-friendly
      dashboard for exploring highway projects in Kentucky.</p>
    <p>The dashboard is built with open web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, Chart.js, and Tabulator.js),
      eliminating reliance on proprietary Esri tools. This removes licensing barriers and makes the tool freely
      accessible to the public.</p>
    <p>The interface is designed to be responsive, adapting to various devices and screen sizes. Interactive features like
    filtering, charting, and map-based exploration make the dashboard intuitive and easy to use, overcoming the
    inflexibility of previous solutions.</p>
    <p>By using lightweight libraries and direct GeoJSON data, the dashboard improves performance and ensures compatibility
    with other open data sources and APIs. SQLite is used for efficient data storage and querying, supporting offline
    access.</p>
    <p>Integration with the KYTC Spatial API and public data files allows users to explore route-specific project metadata
    without restrictions, supporting transparency and public engagement.</p>
    </details>

    <details open>
    <summary><h2 id="functionality">Code Functionality and Use:</h2></summary>
      <p>JavaScript is the backbone of the dashboard's interactivity, visulization, and modularity, making the application
        functional, user-friendly, and responsive.</p>
      <p>It is essential for enabling all of the dynamic features of the dashboard:
        <ul>
          <li>Data Loading & API Integration:</li>
            <p>JavaScript fetches project data from GeoJSON files, SQLite databases, and the KYTC Spatial API.
              This allows the dashboard to display up-to-date information and route-specific metadata.</p>
          <li>Map Visualization:</li>
            <p>Using Leaflet.js, JavaScript renders interactive maps, displays project locations, and
              enables user interactions such as clicking on features to view details.</p>
          <li>Charting & Data Visualization:</li>
            <p>JChart.js is used via JavaScript to generate dynamic pie and bar charts, helping users
            visualize project distributions and summaries.</p>
          <li>Filtering & Sorting:</li>
            <p>JavaScript powers the filtering logic, allowing users to select counties, districts, or project types. It updates the
            map, charts, and data table in real time based on user selections.</p>
          <li>Interactive Data Table:</li>
            <p>Tabulator.js is used to create sortable, filterable, and exportable tables. JavaScript manages the table’s data, updates
            it when filters change, and enables export to CSV/Excel.</p>
          <li>Responsive UI & Modular Components:</li>
            <p>JavaScript ensures the dashboard adapts to different devices and screen sizes, and supports modular architecture so
            components (map, charts, table) can be reused or extended.</p>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Modularization</h3>

      <p>A challenging aspect of this project has been modularizing the dashboard's codebase. Ensuring
        that each component is self-contained and reusable requires careful planning and implementation.
      </p>
      <p>Modularizing the dashboard requires decoupling logic, managing shared state, abstracting third-party
        integrations, refactoring styles, and designing clear interfaces for each component. This can
        be time-consuming but will greatly improve reusability and maintainability.</p>
      <p>Some logic is intertwined between the map charts and table, making it challenging to separate
        them into distinct components. However, the overall architecture is designed to allow for
        future enhancements and modularization.

    <h3>CodeYou Experience</h3>
    <p>The Web Development Cohort has been my second experience with Code:You. Last year I participated
      in the Data Analytics Cohort, which provided a strong foundation in data analysis and visualization.
      This year, I have stretched my existing JavaScript skills from years ago to study new methodologies and
      tools to focus on creating interactive and user-friendly web applications.</p>
    </p>
    <p>A key skill I have developed is the ability to quickly prototype and iterate on ideas using JavaScript frameworks like React and Svelte.
      This will greatly enhance my efficiency and effectiveness in future projects.</p>
