      <summary><h2>Main Features</h2></summary>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interactive Map:</strong>
            <p>View and explore highway projects across Kentucky.
                  Zoom, pan, and click on project lines for more specific details.
                  Zoom in and out by using the zoom button or mouse scroll wheel. If you double-click
                  on the map, it will zoom in to the location incrementally. If you want to zoom out,
                  you can use the zoom out button or hold down the "Shift" key and double-click on the map.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Filter Options:</strong>
          <p>County/District filters (3rd & 4th buttons from the top)
              Use the buttons on the right side of the map to select one of the filters to get a
              dropdown list of counties or districts.  Select a county name or district number to
              zoom the map to the boundary of that polygon.  The graphs and the data table will also
              filter to display the filtered information.
          </p>
          <p>Project Type filter (5th button from the top)
              The project type filters data from a curated list of project types.  Individual projects
              can have multiple project types.  If you select a project type, the map will zoom to the
              limits of all projects of that type.  The graphs and data table will filter to display
              the filtered records.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Project Graphs:</strong>
          <p>The top graph is pie chart that shows the distribution of projects across both awarded and
            current projects. If you have made a county or district selection in the map, the pie chart
            will update to show only the projects that match the selection.</p>
          <p>The bottom graph is a bar chart that displays the number of projects by 6-yr plan year.
            This chart will also update based on your map selections.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data Table:</strong>
          <p>Browse, filter, sort, and export project data in a tabular format.
            The table includes columns for District, County, Project ID, Route, Type of Work,
            Beginning Milepoint, Ending Milepoint, Bridge ID (if part of project), Plan Year,
            and Status (if known). Filter and sort the table by clicking on the column headers.
            Export results as Excel, CSV, or Json files.</p>

      <summary><h2>FAQ</h2></summary>
      <p><strong>Q: How do I reset the dashboard?</strong><br>
      A: Refresh the page or use the reset "CLR" button on the map.</p>

      <p><strong>Q: How do I use the KYTC API for route information?</strong><br>
      A: Click on KYTC API button (bottom button on right hand side of map).  A small dialog
      will appear in the lower left corner over the legend button, instructing you to select the
      route you are interested in learning more about.  Double-click the map to zoom in to the
      desired location.  When you mouse-over the route, the mouse cursor will change from the
      "hand" to a pointer. Click the route and you will see the unique identifier and milepoints
      for the clicked route in the API dialog.  Click the button on the dialog to send the request
      to the API.  The API will retrieve detailed route information from the API and return it to
      a popup window overlying the graph area.  You can then view the route details and export them
      using the buttons on the API window.</p>

      <p><strong>Q: Who can I contact for support?</strong><br>
      A: Please refer to the project README or contact the dashboard administrator.</p>
